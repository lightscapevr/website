                    <p>VR Sketch is an extension/plugin for
                        <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> that lets you use SketchUp while inside virtual reality (VR).</p>
                    <p>With any SketchUp file open you just click "Send to VR" and you can start walking around your file.</p>
                    <p>It's not just for viewing your files, you can draw and edit while in VR. All the major SketchUp tools
                        are available in VR, so you can push/pull, move, draw, copy, scale and much more.</p>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Yes. We have spend lots of development time optimising VR Sketch to work with files of all sizes. If
                        your files are super large your hardware (normally your GPU) may struggle. We have also found that
                        keeping your geometry inside groups and components helps speed things up.</p>
                    <p>Note that Oculus Quest's GPU is much less powerful than a PC's.  For the Quest, the answer to the question above is No: it will struggle to render models that are a lot larger than the medium-sized demo model "Cliff House".</p>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Yes. VR Sketch supports two modes:</p>
                    <ol>
<li>Directly from the machine running SketchUp, where the person in VR
can view and edit the model currently opened in SketchUp.  Any changes
done in VR are immediately reflected on the SketchUp model, and any
changes done on the screen in SketchUp are immediately reflected in
VR.  This allows direct collaboration between two persons,
one in VR and one on the screen.</li>
<li>If you <a href="docs-collaboration.html" target="_blank">upload a model</a> to the cloud, then any number of VR
installations can view it and make simple annotations without using
SketchUp any more (but the model cannot be edited).  These VRs can be
far away from each other.  If several people view the same model at
the same time, then they see each other's avatars in VR, and can talk
to each other via voice-over-IP.</li>
                    </ol>
<p>The trial license of VR Sketch is for trying out the direct mode.  Uploading
a model to the cloud requires storage space on our servers and is thus limited
to non-trial licenses.  On the other hand, if you only want to use VR Sketch to
view cloud models, you can do so with no license at all---you are always
allowed to view models uploaded by someone else (including the demo models we
provide), as long as you know their URL.</p>

                Why is there no fluid walkthrough movement?  Why is walking mode done in "steps"?
            </a>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Movements in VR Sketch are based on teleporting. Version 12.0 adds a mode called "walking": it is still not continuous movement, but it is done as a series of small, instantaneous teleports that correspond to "steps". This mode can be choosen in the context menu ("Menu" or "B" button) of the Teleport tool.</p>
                    <p>The #1 rule for VR comfort is: the VR view should never be subject to any acceleration. That is because the headset cannot physically give your body the impression that you are accelerating---it can only fool the eyes. Attempting to do accelerated movements induces sickness, similar to being a passenger in a car on a mountain road. Some persons are more prone to it than others; it can take anywhere between a few seconds and half an hour to make the user sick, if at all. We feel it would be quite unprofessional to submit the majority of users to a feature that appears fine at first, but renders them sick after a while. Teleporting is a good workaround, because it lets the user move around without ever being subject to acceleration.</p>
                    <p>The "walking" mode added in version 12.0 is a (possibly good) compromize. It gives a feeling similar to real-life steps, and actually is a lot more natural than continuous movement---the latter feels more like flying, in addition to the motion sickness issues. For these reasons, this will likely remain the only "walking" mode available in VR Sketch.</p>
