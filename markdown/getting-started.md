# Requirements

Windows:

* a VR headset: HTC Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, Oculus Rift/Rift S,
  Oculus Link, Oculus Quest (1 or 2 or Pro or 3), or Pico Neo 3.
  Windows Mixed Realities headsets work, but they are not officially supported.
  Vive Cosmos is untested; feedback welcome.
* VR controllers: they usually come with the headset, but Vive/Index headsets support mixing controllers and using non-standard ones, like the Logitech VR Ink.
* Software: SketchUp 2017 to 2022 are currently supported. (We are considering adding a standalone version that works without SketchUp. SketchUp 2017 Make is free; see our <a href="faqs.html">FAQ</a> about SketchUp 2017.)

Mac:

* Oculus Quest 1 or 2 or Pro, or Pico Neo 3.  (As of 2024, OS X and tethered VR headsets are not working well together in general.)
* SketchUp 2020 to 2022.  (Required for proper editing.  SketchUp 2017-2019 would work as well but is not tested, and the "open group" command from VR doesn't.)

*See our separate documentation pages <a href="docs-getting-started-quest.html">for the Oculus Quest</a> or
<a href="docs-getting-started-piconeo.html">for the Pico Neo 3</a> headsets.*
