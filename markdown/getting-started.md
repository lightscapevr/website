# Requirements

Windows:

* a VR headset: HTC Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, Oculus Rift/Rift S, Oculus Link, or Oculus Quest (1 or 2).  Windows Mixed Realities headsets work, but they are not officially supported.  Vive Cosmos is untested; feedback welcome.
* VR controllers: they usually come with the headset, but Vive/Index headsets support mixing controllers and using non-standard ones, like the Logitech VR Ink.
* Software: SketchUp 2017 to 2020 are currently supported. (We are considering adding a standalone version that works without SketchUp.)

Mac:

* Oculus Quest 1 or 2.  (As of 2020, OS X and tethered VR headsets are not working well together in general.)
* SketchUp 2020.  (Required for proper editing.  SketchUp 2017-2019 would work as well but the "open group" command from VR doesn't.)

*For Oculus Quest, see the <a href="docs-getting-started-quest.html">separate documentation page.</a>*
