# Requirements

* OS: Currently only works on Windows. If you want Mac support and you are willing to sponsor
  the necessary equipment, please get in touch. Note that OS X and VR are, as of 2019, not working
  well together. If you can show us a combination of software/hardware that works well, we can consider
  supporting it.
* VR headsets: HTC Vive, Valve Index, Oculus Rift, Oculus Link. Windows Mixed Realities headsets work, but they are not officially supported.  See <a href="docs-getting-started-quest.html">here for Oculus Quest.</a>
* Software: SketchUp 2017 to 2019 are currently supported. (We are considering adding a standalone version that works without SketchUp.)
