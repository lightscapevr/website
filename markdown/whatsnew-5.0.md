## What's new in 5.0

5.0 was a massive release for us. We implemented many things we have been
talking about and we have streamlined a lot of things that have been there
already. Overall VR Sketch 5.0 is we believe a massive improvement over previous
versions!

### Context menu
<img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/docs/new-5/context-menu.jpg" alt="Context-menu in VR Sketch 5.0"> 

The biggest change is the context menu. Right now if you press **small top button**
on a Vive controller or **Y or B** on Oculus Rift, you would get a small context
menu that depends on the tool. You can read about all the possibilities in
[our drawing docs](docs-drawing.html)

### Scenes and Layers
<img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/docs/new-5/scenes-menu.jpg" alt="Scenes-menu in VR Sketch 5.0"> 

Scenes now are accessible from the settings menu, near **Teleport tool**.
You can also make new scenes from your current viewpoint.  And in the
layers page, you can enable or disable them, as well as change the layer
in which groups and components are.

### 3d warehouse

You can now place components from the 3D warehouse directly! To do that,
go to components like usual, above select, and select the 3D warehouse panel.

### Viewing tools

We have completely revamped the view tools. They are now all available while
hovering over the teleport tool. You can explore yourself or read [our docs](docs-viewing.html).
Don't miss the new camera tool!

### Box tool
<img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/docs/new-5/box-tool.jpg" alt="Box tool in VR Sketch 5.0"> 

Draw 3D boxes with ease with this new tool. You can find it above the rectangle tool.

### Laser Select tool
<img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/docs/new-5/laser-select.jpg" alt="Laser select tool in VR Sketch 5.0"> 

Now you can select things from a distance using the Laser Select tool. It work very similar way to the
standard select tool. You can find it above the standard select tool.

## Things that aren't new, but you might not have heard about them

### Collaboration
<img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/docs/new-5/collaboration.jpg" alt="Collaboration in VR Sketch 5.0"> 

We have enabled cloud-based collaborative viewing of models! You can now
share the model and audio with other people with other VR headsets.
